## Description
Data engineering and analysis project using real commercial data from the Brazilian e-commerce platform Olist. The architecture consumes a single data source (in .csv format) publicly available. Learn more about the dataset: [Kaggle - Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## About the Dataset
Public dataset of Brazilian e-commerce from Olist. This dataset contains information on 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018 across various marketplaces in Brazil. The data allows viewing orders across multiple dimensions: status, price, payment, shipping performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer-written reviews. A geolocation dataset is also available, linking Brazilian postal codes to lat/lng coordinates.

These are real commercial data that have been anonymized. References to companies and partners have been replaced with the names of the great houses of Game of Thrones.

## Data Engineering
The data engineering of this project used a list of tools and methods, including:
- DuckDB

## Objective
The focus of this project is to apply fundamental concepts of data engineering and analysis, delivering results through dashboards, reports, and using Business Intelligence (BI).

## BI Dashboard
The dashboard for this project was built using the Python libraries: Streamlit and Plotly. Moreover, this Data App features a native AI Agent to assist users with decision-making and data exploration beyond the static visualization of Streamlit, allowing for understanding and answering complex and strategic questions based on the data.

### CoPilot Business Agent
The dashboard's native AI Agent is called the Copilot Business Agent. It functions as a tool for exploration, analysis, and guidance based on the data present in the dashboard.
