## Description

A data engineering and analytics project based on real commercial data from the Brazilian e-commerce platform Olist. The architecture consumes a single data source (in `.csv` format) that is publicly available. Learn more about the dataset: [Kaggle - Brazilian E-commerce Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce).

## About the Dataset

A public dataset from Olist's Brazilian e-commerce platform. This dataset contains information on 100,000 orders placed between 2016 and 2018 across various marketplaces in Brazil. The data allows for order analysis across multiple dimensions: status, price, payment, shipping performance, customer location, product attributes, and customer-written reviews. Additionally, a geolocation dataset is available, mapping Brazilian postal codes to lat/lng coordinates.

This is real commercial data that has been anonymized. References to companies and partners have been replaced with names from the major houses of _Game of Thrones_.

## Data Schema

The data is divided into multiple datasets for better understanding and organization. Refer to the following data schema when working with it:
